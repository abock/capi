CAPI is an *experimental* C Preprocessor and C tokenizer written in C#.

The ultimate goal is to possibly replace gapi-parser with something that is
actually sane, and not a glob of fragile stateless perl regular expressions.

It is in VERY early development. The basic lexer and parser are in place,
and most of the CPP logic is in place, but nothing else. Do not use! ;-)
